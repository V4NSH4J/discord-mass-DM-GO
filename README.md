Old Discord Server link removed as it was terminated. Someone claimed the vanity to promote a Scam on DMDGO's name. DMDGO does not have any Paid products and does not offer any subscriptions. Anyone using DMDGO name or V4NSH4J's name to promote anything is a scam. I do not have an official Discord anymore, my only telegram is @campingarunner and my email is v4nsh4j@proton.me

## Disclaimer 
 The automation of User Discord accounts also known as self-bots is a violation of Discord Terms of Service & Community guidelines and will result in your account(s) being terminated. Discretion is adviced. I will not be responsible for your actions. Read about Discord [Terms Of service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines)
 
Discord Mass DM GO (DMDGO) was written as a proof of concept that Discord accounts can be automated and can perform actions beyond the scope of regular Discord Users like sending Embeds so that Discord can make changes.

## Basic Usage
1) [Build from source](https://github.com/V4NSH4J/discord-mass-DM-GO#building-from-source-) or download a pre-built version for your OS & Arch from [releases](https://github.com/V4NSH4J/discord-mass-DM-GO/releases)
2) Run the program via the binary. 
3) Set your [Config](https://github.com/V4NSH4J/discord-mass-DM-GO#configuration) by modifying the `config.yml` file. 
4) If you already have memberids to DM, put them in `\input\memberids.txt` or obtain them from [Scraping]()
5) Put HTTP(s) Proxies in `\input\proxies.txt` if you enabled proxies in config. The format is IP:Port or User:pass@IP:Port if your proxies have a user-pass authentication. 
6) Enter your message(s) in `message.json` file. You can use [this](https://glitchii.github.io/embedbuilder/?editor=json) website to easily make JSON objects. However, if you do not want to/ are unable to format the file properly, you will have an option to input a simple message before mass DM-ing. Writing "\<user\>" without quotes anywhere in message content will ping the user to whom you're sending a message. Please make sure to use \n to change lines. You may pick an [example]() message.json and build from it.

## Building from source
1) Download and install [Golang](https://go.dev/) and verify your installation
2) Open a terminal window/ command prompt in the directory of the source code and type `go build`
3) A binary compatible with your OS/Arch should be made. If there are some problems on MacOS/Linux with executing the binary as a program. You can run this command `chmod +x ./discord-mass-dm-GO` or go to properties -> permissions -> Allow executing file as program.

Name | Type | Recommended Value | Description |
| -----|------|-------------------|-------------|
|`observer_token`| string | "your token" | A token which is present in the server where yo want to sniff reactions and send DMs. This token is only used for looking at the reacts, it's never used to send DMs. |
|`change_name`| bool | true | An instance token changes name before sending DMs to people approved by observer token. Requires tokens in format email:pass:token|
|`change_avatar`| bool | true | An instance token changes avatar before sending DMs to people apporved by observer token. |
|`invite`| string | "invite_to_server" | Invite to the server where you're running DM on react, to join instances when they're needed so they don't get kicked. If not specified, the bot will assume the tokens are already present in the server |
|`server_id`| string | "server_id" | Server ID where you're running the DM on react. If not specified, instances will try to send to every reaction sniffed by observer token. This is required for other things like checking if Token is in server or not, it's highly recommended you specify this field. |

|`message_id`| string | "your_messageId" | Message ID of the message on which you want to send people DMs who react. If left blank, would send DMs to all messages in the channel. |
|`emoji`| string | "emojiname:id" | The emoji when reacted with the message will be sent. Unicode emojis have to be entered just as the emoji. Example: "🚀" (Don't worry if it appears as boxes on your machine) And for custom/nitro emojis you have to put emoji_name:emoji_id which you can get from the emoji's URL. If left blank, messages will be sent to every reaction on the message. |
|`rotate_tokens`| bool | true | Re-uses tokens from a pool. Suppose if token was rate limited, it would be switched but later be returned to to be reused. |
|`max_anti_raid_queue`| int | 20 |To ensure someone does not spam reactions to jam your bot and lock your instances, you can set the maximum queue size. Any reactions above this would be discarded. This will easily help bypass mass emoji reacts breaking the bot. |
|`max_dms_per_token`| int | 0 | Maximum DMs you want your tokens to send. Set to 0 for unlimited.










### Offset 
Offset is a duration in milliseconds. As the name suggests this offsets or displaces the goroutines (threads) by a short period of time to ensure that all accounts don't start at the exact same second. What is the recommended offset? If you have less than 100 tokens or are using short individual delays, it does not matter. You can put any offset like 50-300. But if you are running a large number of tokens, you should set your individual and rate limit delays to 60 each or higher. Your offset will come with this formula - (individual delay/number of tokens) * 1000 This ensures your tokens start evenly spread out throughout the individual delay period. 
You can do more interesting things with offset. Normally to bypass Anti-Raid bots like Beemo or Wick, you'd have to join your tokens with high delays then wait for all of them to join to start DMing. Now with Offset you can make it so that one account joins and starts DMing, 30 seconds or any duration of your choice later the second account joins and start DMing so you save A LOT of time. How to do this? Set your offset to the duration you want your accounts to join in, like 30,000 - 60,000 (Remember offset is in milliseconds) and don't join your accounts to the server. Before Mass DMing, you'd get an option for advanced settings. Enter the server invite and serverid there. Use multiple proxies/ rotating proxies to prevent Discord server IP bans by the Anti-Raid bots. This won't work while Proxyless. 

## Using Captcha APIs
Captcha Solving APIs were introduced to DMDGO on 8th February 2022 when Discord mandated Captchas for joining servers on some tokens they deemed untrustworthy. The supported Captcha APIs right now are capmonster.cloud and anti-captcha.com 
You can register an account there, load some balance and copy your Captcha API Key to config. Make sure to specify the service you're using as well. It is extremely inexpensive and can join thousands of accounts in a couple USD. If there is an error with the captcha APIs, You will get an error code. You can look it up on their documentation [here](https://anti-captcha.com/apidoc/errors)

### Example configuration
```json
{
    "individual_delay": 60,
    "rate_limit_delay": 60,
    "offset": 100,
    "skip_completed": true,
    "skip_failed": true,
    "remove_dead_tokens": true,
    "remove_completed_members": true,
    "stop_dead_tokens": true,
    "check_mutual": false,
    "friend_before_DM": false,
    "online_tokens": false,
    "online_scraper_delay": 2000,
    "call": false,
    "proxy_from_file": false,
    "max_dms_per_token": 0,
    "receive_messages": true,
    "use_proxy_for_gateway": false,
    "timeout": 60,
    "captcha_api": "capmonster.cloud",
    "captcha_api_key": "your_captcha_api_key",
    "max_attempt_invite_rejoin": 4,
    "disable_keep_alives": false
}
```
This is the config I'd use, with ofcourse the offset calculated accordingly. 

## Message in file
The `input/message.json` is an array of messages from which one is chosen at random to be sent before each DM. Message.json is an array of messages. Find the examples below to add multiple messages. You can use the "get message" option to get messages from discord as well. Be sure to have the [] around the whole message. The only way to change lines is adding `\n`. After discord update on 22nd January 2022; Embed support was removed from DMDGO V1.7.5 and higher as discord removed the capibility to send embeds completely from userbots

### Example message 1 : Single Message, No Embed
```json
[
  {
    "content": "Hi <user> join my telegram server https://t.me/tosviolators"
  }
]
```

### Example message 2: Multiple messages, No Embeds. 
```json
[
  {
    "content": "Hi <user> join my telegram server https://t.me/tosviolators"
  },
  {
    "content": "We had a discord but it got terminated"
  },
  {
    "content": "We might make one again but too lazy to do so"
  }
]
```

## How to Debug problems with Mass DMing / Message 
For problems with setting the JSON files. Read this document very carefully and try understanding a bit of JSON. You can use [JSON Lint](https://jsonlint.com/) or similar to validate your JSON files and fix errors. The structure for all files is clearly defined here. 
For problems with sending DMs/ Any other function, the best way to diagnose is logging into the token and see what's going on. I highly recommend not to use email:password to login as it might trigger the New Login Location prompt. It's better to login via tokens. [Click here](https://gist.github.com/m-Phoenix852/d63d869f16e40dac623c9aa347e8641a) for a simple and fast token login script by @m-Pheonix852
Once logged into the token, you can see if it's still in the server / diagnose other problems with channel veriifcation levels, etc. You may also read the FAQs. Always keep in mind, when using self-bots you can only do actions that normal users can do. If you try DMing someone with no mutuals or friends, you can't DM them. Similarly, this self-bot can't either. 

## Scraping [Experimental Menu as of DMDGO v1.7.0]
The Scraping menu is a new functionality introduced in DMDGO V1.7.0 Before that, DMDGO recommended the use of [Discum's Scraper](https://gist.github.com/V4NSH4J/06c452f32ceb5f6387b66abd8ccedd74) 
This menu is still unstable and needs a lot of improvement. For stability, you can use the Discum Scraper. But if you do decide to use the scraper from DMDGO, It's explained here. 
- *Online Scraper (Opcode 14)* : Scrapes members from the member list visible on the right hand side of a discord server. This is usually only online members in case of larger servers as the offline member list usually gets hidden when servers are larger than 1000 members. 

- *Scrape from Reactions*: Does not use websocket, incase you see a reaction with a large number of reacts from which you'd like to get users, you can use this option. The one downside to this is that it would also scrape reacts from users who may have already left the server. 

- *Offline Scraper* (Opcode 8) : Scrapes members using OP8 websocket requests. This is what goes on behind the screens when you search for members in the search bar or by using @ in chat. This is usually slow with 1 account as it's bruteforcing which is why this mode supports multiple tokens for faster scrapes. It can't get all the users because of limitations described in [Discum's Docs](https://github.com/Merubokkusu/Discord-S.C.U.M/blob/master/docs/using/fetchingGuildMembers.md) but it gets a substantial number more users than the Opcode 14 scraper. You'll have to press ENTER to start and stop this scraper as it has the potential to go on for a very long time. Recommended to use multiple tokens and they need to be in the server before you start scraping. This function was slowed down on purpose to avoid any sort of rate limits. It will save IDs automatically to memberids.txt and you'll have to stop it manually when it's no longer getting IDs.

## Token Functionality [Updated: 14th January 2022]
The number of DMs you get per token depends on your token's quality and it's verification status. Unverified tokens (No email, No Phone number) get around 5 DMs. Email Verified tokens get around 50 DMs and Phone verifieds have the potential to go more than 50. 
These are ofcourse the *maximum/ideal* number of DMs as they were tested on botted servers where every DM was open. In a real-DMing scenerio, this number can be lesser. 
Whenever you buy tokens from a new seller, buy less tokens first to test out their quality. You can do this by manually sending DMs. Discord often flags the domains on which tokens are made, when this happens your tokens will struggle to even get 1 DM. Sometimes the phone number on the accounts is flagged as well. So always check before buying. 
Aged tokens have the potential to do thousands of DMs without ever getting disabled. But the type of tokens you want to use would depend on the servers you want to target and the cost efficiency. The mean DM price from DM-services is $0.01. The cost of an email verified token is $0.03 on average right now. Which would make the cost of DMs if you use email verifieds around $0.0006 - $ 0.001 which is more than 10 times cheaper. 
If you're new to this and want to try out your hand, I recommend going for cheap email verifieds to test. Other than that, it is upto you to narrow your targets and find your cost efficiency. 

## Mass DMing
Before you start Mass DMing, You will have an option for Advanced Settings. You may set a Serverid and invite code there. If the token is not in the server, the token will stop sending messages or try to rejoin the server. 
For best efficiency, use the recommended setting for delays. 
If you get spammed with errors "Cannot send messages to this user", make sure you're using the right memberids and that your tokens are in the server. 
If you get the error "Channel verification too high", this could be because you're trying to use email verified tokens on a server which requires phone verification or because the server has a 10 minute timer which you'd need to wait out before sending messages (Can be confirmed by loggin in with a token)
Sometimes, servers have anti-raid bots which detect suspicious patterns in joining like a lot of accounts with similar recent dates of registeration, no profile picture and random names joining within a certain time period. They may kick/ban the accounts, in such an event, you will not be able to send messages. Check out the method described [here]() or use high delays while joining such servers

## Proxies, Tokens and the Discord Self-Bot market in general
DMDGO was tested using Proxiware's Static Proxies and Iproyal's Rotating proxies. It may or may not work properly with free proxies from proxiscrape. Those are the worst proxies you can find on the internet. Using a proxies with gateway functions is not recommended.
Tokens are Discord accounts, they will be sending DMs for you. There are few ways to get them, the simplest being to buy them. Whenever you buy tokens, please check the quality and only buy more if they're good. Or you can buy/make/find a token generator. 
The Discord-Self bot market is very risky. A word of advice, don't purchase from unreputed people and use middlemen on reputed forums for large transactions. You will get scammed most of the times otherwise. The market is full of highly elaborate scammers like [Exordium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uw7wjBxNK-4&ab_channel=Exordium) targetting people with his purchased channel and botted impressions. He will take your money and block you. And the owners of Anonix who will hapilly sell you open source code. 
Exit scams happen here all the time. Take recent incident of one of the MassDN partners Certex who exit scammed $60,000+ by ratting their customers. This is not to scare you to make purchases, this is just to warn you that you are likely to get scammed especially as a newcomer so stay vigilant. I decided to include this in the readme because everyday I see several people getting scammed.

A: [Download](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-GB/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170) this for your OS/Arch

#### Q: My program closes instantly
A: Open up a command prompt, drag and drop the exe to it and try to run. This way it will show you the error before exiting

#### Q: Error 400
A: Error 400 is a malformed request and is a fault at your end. Either the channel IDs are wrong / the token is trying to DM itself. Or your message is empty (Empty messages can't be sent on discord) stuff like that. 
 
#### Q: Error 400 [Code: 40001 Message: Unauthorized]
 A: Your token has never been connected to a websocket before. Use token onliner in DMDGO v1.0.7 and above.

#### Q: Error 405/403/401
A: Error 403 stands for "Forbidden" and Error 405 stands for "Method not allowed", 403 arrises due to several reasons - You're blocked by the Receiver, you don't share a mutual server with them, you're phone locked, you're email locked, You haven't completed member screening, Receiver's DMs are closed, etc. Meanwhile Error 405 usually happens when you try to do something that can't be done normally on discord, based on how the program works, this might arise if your tokens get locked/ disabled. Error 401 stands for "Unauthorized" and may mean that your token is invalid/locked. You may also get Error 403 if you try to DM users in a phone verification required server with email verified tokens.

#### Q: What is rate limit delay? 
A: Discord limits the speed with which you can send New DMs. As of November 2021, this limit is 10 new DMs every 10 minutes. Once the token gets rate limited, it will wait out the duration mentioned in config in front of rate limit delay. This is not bypassable, if anyone/ any other program claims it can bypass it, it's a lie. 

#### Q: What kind of tokens are recommended? 
A: Fully verified tokens with a valid email and phone number

#### Q: Do I need to keep discord open? 
A: No, you only need to keep this program open to send messages.

#### Q: My OS/Arch is not listed in releases?
A: Build it yourself, it is explained in the readme file.

#### Q: Discum is auto-exiting
A: Make sure you've made a file `users.txt` in the same directory as the script if you're using the version of Discum from my readme. Also run Discum in CMD and not by double clicking.

#### Q: Should I use proxies? If yes which ones? 
A: It is totally upto you, I personally don't see the need for proxies yet using this. But some people like it as it does seem more believeable. If you intend to use proxies with this, you'd need HTTPs rotating proxies.
 
#### Q: What is the proxy format? 
A: The proxy format is username:password@hostname:port

#### Q: Error 429/ I can't join servers?
A: Your IP is softbanned / you are rate limited, use a VPN. It will be fixed.

#### Q: What is membership screening/ minimum security of servers preventing me from DMing? 
A: It looks something like this: 
 
 
![Membership Screening](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/905121020430659597/908460971171909662/sdgsdg.PNG)
 
You need to be past this in order to send any DMs to members in that server.

#### Q: How to better debug what's going wrong? 
A: Login into your token and try to understand what's going wrong. I recommend this [script](https://gist.github.com/m-Phoenix852/d63d869f16e40dac623c9aa347e8641a) .

#### Q: I put in my tokens, memberIDs, config and message but it can't find them? 
A: Make sure you've compiled and are running the binary. Doing `go run main.go` does not work as the program finds the above mentioned files using the relative path to the exe. Doing `go run main.go` makes a temporary exe somewhere. 

#### Q: Will you mass DM for me? 
A: I will not, this program is just a Proof of Concept. Using it to actually launch DM advertisement campaigns & spamming is a violation of Discord TOS & Community guidelines. This is only for documenting & researching.

#### Q: Channel verification too high?
A: This happens in a few scenerios. You're trying to use unverified tokens to DM in a server which needs Phone/Email verification OR you're trying to use email verified tokens in a server which requires phone verification. This may also happen if the server has a 10 minute wait time before you can interact in it, to verify, login into a token and see. It may also happen if for some reason, DMDGO failed to bypass the token which it does automatically.

#### Q: Invalid character `e` looking for beginning of value error code: 1015 
A: Cloudflare Error 1015 is an IP Based Rate limit. You have to use proxies/ VPN to get around it
